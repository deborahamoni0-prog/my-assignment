### EXECUTION HASH
It refers to a cryptographic hash that represents the execution layer state of ethereum (formerly the eth1 layer)
it summarizes what happened during transactions executions .
it also reflects smart contract execution, account balances, and state changes.
### FINALIZED ROOT
This is a state root that has permanently accepted  by the ethereum network
once a block is finalized, it cannot be reverted.
finalization occurs after validators agree through consensus
it represents the finalized state of the blockchain at a given point
### EPOCH
An epoch is a group of slots in ethereun's consensus system
1epoch = 32 slots
Epoch are used for validators duties and finalization.
consensus decisions (like finalization) happen at epoch boundaries 
### SLOTS
A slot is a fixed time window during which a block can be proposed .
Each slot lasts 12seconds.
Not every slots must contain a block.
validators are assigned to propose or attest in specific slots.
They keep block production predictable.
### BLOCK HASH
A block hash is a unique identifier for a block.
It is generated by hashing the block's contents.
Even a tiny change in the block changes the hash.
it is used to link blocks together in a chain.
Block hashes ensure intergrity and ordering of blocks
### FORK CHOICE
This is the rule used to decide which chain is the "correct" one when multiple chains exist.
Ethereum uses LMD-GHOST casper FFG fork choice.
The chain with the most validators support is chosen.
Temporary forks can happen, but fork choice resolves them.

# IMPLEMENTATION
###### Execution hash implementation
1. Each block includes a list of transactions .
2. start with the previous block's execution state root
3. Apply each transactions in order;
* Deduct sender balance + gas 
* update receiver balance
* Execute smart contract code (update storage).
4. After all transactions,compute the merkle root(state root) of all accounts
5. store this as the execution hash in the block header.

###### Finalized Root implementations
1. Ethereum uses casper FFG(finality gadget) for proof-of state.
2. validators vote on checkpoints(every epoch).
3. When >2/3 of validators vote for a checkpoint, it becomes justified.
4. when the next checkpoint is justified on top of it, the previous checkpoint becomes finalized.
5. The finalized root is simply the state root of the finalized block.

###### Epoch & block hash
epoch; (Group of 32 slots)
validators are assigned duties per epoch.
slots per epoch = 32
###### Block hash
1. Take all block header fields (parents _hash, timestamp, exec_hash, etc.)
2. compute SHA-256(or keccak256)hash.
 
###### slots implementation
1. Each validator is assigned a slots to propose a block.
2. if no block is proposed in a slot'n slot remains empty.
3. slot number=(current_time-genesis_time)/SLOT_DURATION.
4. Block creation and attestation happens within the assigned slot

###### Fork choice
1. Ethereum uses LMD-GHOST casper FFG;
*  Start from the latest justified block.
*  Traverse children blocks with most attestation votes.
2. the chain with the highest validators weight is chosen as canonical.

# The Ethereum Blockchain Explorer (Etherscan) & Transaction Hash

## The Ethereum Blockchain Explorer (Etherscan)

### Overview Page Observations
On the Etherscan overview homepage, I observed the following key metrics in the network:
1. **Live Ether Price**: In real-time, this displays the current price of ETH.
2. **Market Capitalization**: Represents the total value of all ETH in circulation.
3. **Transactions**: This displays the total number of transactions processed on the Ethereum network, increasing continuously as new transactions are confirmed.
4. **Last Finalized Block**: This shows us the most recent block that has achieved finality.


#### A table that display the lastest blocks
After clicking on the latest block at the time, there are several details I observed about the block and they are:

1. **Block Height**: This indicates the length of the blockchain, increases after the addition of the new block.
2. **Status**: As at the time I checked it, it was finalized. This shows the status of the finality of the block.
3. **Proposed On** and **Timestamps**: Basically, this gives us information about when the transaction started. 
4. Withdrawals
5. **Fee Recipient**: This gives us basic information about the receiver of the transaction.
6. **Block Reward**: This is the total reward earned from the miner.
7. Gas information
8. Block Size
9. **Extra Data**: More information about the recipient


#### A table that display the lastest transactions

After clicking on the latest transaction at the time, there are several transaction details and they are:

##### Transaction Overview
1. **Transaction Hash**: A unique 64-bit character id for ay given transaction.
2. **Status**: This shows us the progress of the transaction.
3. Block
4. Timestamp**: Giving us information about when the transaction took place.

##### Transaction Cost Details
This gives us information about the cost of transaction like its fee and gas price.

Etherscan serves as a powerful blockchain explorer for transparently analyzing Ethereum&apos;s blocks, transactions, and validator behavior.

## Transaction Hash

### Overview Page Observations

Similar to the overview page of the etherscan of several transactions and blocks, this page gives us a keen view of the information that pertains to a particular transaction.

We have the transaction hash of this transaction, the status, spacific block and the amount of block confirmations, timestamp from the time it was proposed (I think), the sender and receiver's wallet address, value of eth sent, transaction fee and gas price.

There&apos;s also a button that when clicked, will show us a dropdown of more information about the transaction

## Conclusion
In conclusion, I think the Etherscan is a powerful blockchain explorer for analyzing Etherum blocks, transactions, and validator behaviour, transparently.
